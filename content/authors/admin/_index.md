I am currently a Ph.D student in Applied Mathematics at the [Laboratory Jacques-Louis Lions](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/?lang=en), working under the supervisor of [Julien Salomon](https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Julien.Salomon/index.php), [Jacques Sainte-Marie](https://team.inria.fr/ange/team-members/jacques-sainte-marie/) in the [INRIA team ANGE](https://team.inria.fr/ange/), and [Olivier Bernard](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Olivier.Bernard/) in the [INRIA team BIOCORE](https://team.inria.fr/biocore/). My research is principally devoted to the modeling and optimisation of Algal Raceway ponds. Moreover, I also work on the Model Order Reduction applied on PDE problems.
