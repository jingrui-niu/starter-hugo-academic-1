abstract: "This paper focuses on mixing strategies and designing shape of the bottom topographies to enhance the growth of the microalgae in raceway ponds. A physical-biological coupled model is used to describe the growth of the algae. A simple model of a mixing device such as a paddle wheel is also considered. The complete process model was then included in an optimization problem associated with the maximization of the biomass production. The results show that non-trivial topographies can be coupled with some specific mixing strategies to improve the microalgal productivity."
